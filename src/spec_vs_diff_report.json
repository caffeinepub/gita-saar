  "summary": "REQ-2 (complete verse dataset and consistency guarantees) is not evidenced in the provided backend diff snippet; the diff only shows chapter metadata generation and adds a migration module. REQ-1 (no truncation in the 5-column table on desktop/mobile) cannot be conclusively verified from the truncated ChapterDetailView diff, though the snippet shows table structure changes.",

      "requirement": "Populate backend verse data so the app contains verse records for every verse in every chapter (all 18 chapters), ensure chapter verse counts match returned verse list sizes, and ensure curated mood lookups only reference existing verses.",
      "reason": "The backend diff snippet shows chapter metadata (verseCount values) but does not show any implementation or data population for the full set of verses across all chapters, nor evidence that getVersesByChapter/getVerse/getCuratedVersesByMood are updated to guarantee full coverage and consistency.",
