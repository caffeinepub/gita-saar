  "summary": "Frontend change in ChatThread.tsx appears to satisfy the plain-English single-sentence \"no verse\" hint requirement. Backend requirements for Krishna-like paraphrased responses and greeting/small-talk handling cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated backend/main.mo diff (the relevant getChatbotResponse implementation is not shown).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Update backend getChatbotResponse in backend/main.mo so supportiveMessage is original/conversational (not direct verse text), always returns non-empty supportiveMessage, followUpQuestions (>=1), and actionStep even without a selectedVerse, and never traps on any input.",
      "reason": "The diff for backend/main.mo is truncated and does not include the getChatbotResponse implementation or any visible changes demonstrating paraphrasing logic, deterministic fallbacks, or non-trapping handling.",

      "requirement": "Add greeting/small-talk handling in backend/main.mo getChatbotResponse so greetings get a friendly greeting + check-in question and small-talk follow-ups, without requiring selectedVerse.",
      "reason": "The diff for backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show getChatbotResponse or any greeting detection/handling logic.",
