  "summary": "Most requested navigation and layout changes appear implemented: a new global sticky TopMenuBar is added and mounted in App across tabs; tab switches and Read Gita internal view switches now scroll to top; Home hero CTAs are arranged in a row; floral assets are swapped to a more prominent image; Read Gita chapter cards show verse counts in bracket format and chapters are sorted. One requirement (Talk to Krishna CTA placement next to portrait) cannot be fully verified due to HomePage truncation.",
