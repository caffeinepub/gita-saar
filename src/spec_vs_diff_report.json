  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented in VerseCard by removing the Hindi translation section and keeping Sanskrit (collapsible), Literal English, Gen Z interpretation, and Action Step. REQ-1 appears partially implemented in ChapterDetailView by showing a 4-column table header without Hindi and updating some layout values (skeleton count, min table width), but the diff is truncated so removal of verse.hindiMeaning in rows and the empty-state colSpan update cannot be fully verified. Two non-requested metadata/tracking files were also modified.",
