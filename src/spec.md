# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Keep “Ask Krishna” UI elements fixed while scrolling, update Read Gita verse presentation to a 5-column table, replace floral decorations with Krishna-life background imagery, and ensure all 18 chapters’ verses are fully populated.

**Planned changes:**
- Make the Home page mini Ask Krishna widget (Krishna portrait + entry UI) sticky/fixed below the TopMenuBar so it stays visible while Home content scrolls.
- Make the Talk to Krishna chat composer fixed at the bottom while the chat thread scrolls independently.
- Update Read Gita chapter detail verse table to a 5-column layout: Chapter:Verse, full Sanskrit, literal Hindi meaning, literal English meaning, and an elegant/respectable Gen‑Z interpretation; keep mobile horizontal scrolling usable.
- Remove the global flower overlay/decorations and apply subtle Krishna-life background imagery across all tabs with readability preserved in light and dark mode.
- Populate backend verse data for all 18 chapters so verse queries return complete results including Sanskrit, literal Hindi/English meanings, and the Gen‑Z interpretation, while keeping required existing verse fields non-empty.

**User-visible outcome:** The Ask Krishna widget stays visible on Home, the chat input stays pinned on Talk to Krishna, Read Gita shows every verse in a consistent 5-column table across all chapters, and the app background uses Krishna-life imagery instead of floral overlays without reducing text/table readability.
