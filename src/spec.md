# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the UI/UX to a soft pink + purple-accent theme aligned with the provided screenshots, and fully populate + present complete Gita Saar content (18 chapters, all verses) with the required four-part format and action step.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the global visual theme so the app uses a clearly pink background across all pages, with intentional purple typography accents for headings, labels, links, active navigation, and emphasis text; keep both light and dark mode readable and consistent.
- Refine UI/UX styling to match the screenshot direction: airy spacing, rounded cards, consistent elevations, serif-forward hero headings where appropriate, unified button styles, and consistent navigation active states across Home, Read Gita, Talk to Krishna, and Discover.
- Populate backend with complete Gita Saar dataset covering all 18 chapters and every verse, where each verse includes Sanskrit, literal Hindi translation, literal English translation, Gen‑Z interpretation, and exactly one action step.
- Update verse presentation UI so each verse card clearly shows labeled sections for “Sanskrit (original)”, “Literal Hindi translation”, “Literal English translation”, and “Gen‑Z interpretation”, with the action step always visible and visually distinct.
- Add an in-page search/filter input on the Read Gita chapter listing screen to filter chapters client-side by English title and Sanskrit subtitle while keeping the existing four-tab structure unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays a consistent pink-and-purple, screenshot-aligned interface in both light and dark mode, users can browse and search all 18 chapters, and every verse is shown with Sanskrit + literal Hindi/English translations + Gen‑Z interpretation and a clearly separated action step.
