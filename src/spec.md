# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine the Home hero layout and background visuals, make the top menu bar global, ensure consistent scroll-to-top navigation, and improve Read Gita chapter list formatting.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust Home hero layout so “Open today’s wisdom” and “Find by mood” appear side-by-side directly under the hero subtext and are visible without scrolling on typical mobile viewports.
- Reposition the “Talk to Krishna” CTA to sit adjacent to the Krishna portrait while keeping responsive, non-overlapping layout.
- Make the Home floral background visuals more prominent while preserving readability in both light and dark mode.
- Show the same sticky top menu bar on all tabs/pages with labels: “Home”, “Read Gita”, “Discover”, “Ask Krishna”, including Home-to-top behavior when already on Home.
- Update navigation so switching tabs and changing views within Read Gita always starts at the top of the newly opened view.
- Ensure Read Gita chapter list shows all 18 chapters and displays each chapter’s total verse count in brackets (e.g., “(47)”), with search filtering still applied over the full set.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home screen’s CTAs are immediately accessible and better arranged on mobile, the floral background is more visible, the top menu is available across all tabs, pages always open scrolled to the top, and Read Gita shows all chapters with verse counts in the list.
